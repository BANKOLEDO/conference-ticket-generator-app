# Frontend Mentor - Conference Ticket Generator Solution

This is my solution to the [Conference Ticket Generator challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/conference-ticket-generator-oq5gFIU12w). It helps reinforce accessibility, responsive design, and real-world form handling using React and Tailwind CSS.

## 📌 Overview

### 🎯 The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- Fill out a form with:
  - Full name
  - Email address (valid format)
  - GitHub username (starting with "@")
  - Upload an avatar image (JPG or PNG, under 500KB)
- See validation messages on errors
- Navigate the form entirely with a keyboard
- Experience accessible form labels, hints, and error messages

## 🛠 My Process

### 🚧 Built With

- Semantic HTML5
- Tailwind CSS (utility-first styling)
- React (functional components with hooks)
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Vite (blazing fast dev build tool)
- CSS variables for color theming
- Accessible custom file upload interactions

---

### 📚 What I Learned

Working on this project helped me practice:

- **Drag and drop file uploads** in React
- **Client-side image validation** for type and file size
- **Managing controlled form inputs with real-time validation**
- Accessibility improvements like keyboard nav, ARIA considerations
- Using `z-index` properly to layer background elements behind content
- Layouts using `flex`, `gap`, and `bg-[url()]` in Tailwind

Here’s a sample of validation logic I’m proud of:

```js
const isGithubValid = (gh) => /^@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+$/.test(gh);
const isEmailValid = (email) => /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/.test(email);
````

### 🔁 Continued Development

Things I plan to improve:

* Exporting the generated ticket as an image (e.g. using `html2canvas`)
* Animations on ticket reveal using Framer Motion
* Switch from inline color variables (`bg-[--color]`) to Tailwind's extended theme
* Create reusable UI components and form field validation hook
